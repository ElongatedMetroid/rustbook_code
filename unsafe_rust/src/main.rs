// "global variable", in rust these are called static variables
// Static variables are similar to constants, static variables can
// only store refrences with the 'static lifetime, which means the
// rust compile can figure out the lifetime and we arent required
// to annotate it explicitly. Another difference is values in a 
// static variable have a fixed address in memory, using the value
// will always access the same data. Constants are allowed to
// duplicate thier data whenever they're used. One last difference
// is that static variables can be mutable, but accessing and 
// modifying mutable static variables is unsafe.
